            <h4>PROJECT OVERVIEW:</h4>
            <p>There’s still so much to improve on the family care ideas. There are serious limits to what the existing platforms can provide to the users. Many people live at a distance from their loved ones these days, so it’s not easy to just “pop in” on them regularly. Of course, not everyone has family members to look after them and those that do may not necessarily want to be taken care of by them. Caring for one or more family members can be demanding. Care & share wants to expand the family care concept beyond seniors health care and nursing homes. The platform's main goal is to enhance the quality of life for the users and their loved ones in a variety of aspects. Care & Share needed an identity that matched their core values and I was delighted to help with design and development.<br><br>

            <h4>PROBLEM:</h4>
            <p>The families of the many are spread out with children, grandchildren, and siblings far away. According to the research and user survey, the majority of participants are concerned about their loved ones’ needs when they are away. They mostly depend upon a sibling or relative who lives near their loved ones. The existing platforms in the market provide the user with an opportunity to create a group of family members to help and care for their loved ones. These platforms are mostly specialized for the elderly with health problems and monitoring. There is a gap to help people with the needs of their loved ones when there is no family member around. There is a need for expanding the family care idea beyond the health monitoring, age, distance and service type.

          <div class="solution">
            <h4>SOLUTION:</h4>
            <p>Comprehensive user research along with a complete study on the most known available platforms in the market has resulted in a sturdy solution for a family care idea. The solution is presented in the shape of a desktop and mobile app called Care & Share. The platform involves family members, friends, neighbors, and volunteers to provide a very strong support system for a family member who needs help. Care & Share wants to cover the gap of not having family members to support by providing an option to hire someone nearby to get help from. This platform closes the gap of care recipient age, the distance, the variety of services, and the variety of caregivers existing in available platforms.

            <p>I went through a comprehensive and iterative design process ranging from user research to wireframe, branding, mockups, prototypes, and user testing. The following shows the iterative process of the Care & Share dashboard main section. It started from a rough idea on a paper to a testable refined dashboard screen.</p><br><br>

          <div class="achievement">
            <p>My idea for this platform design started with finding a solution for my own personal concern. I left my parents in my home country to pursue my dreams in another country. I face daily the pressure of my concern for my parents. At some point, I thought someone else might experience the same for their loved ones. I have gone through comprehensive research and understanding of what makes people concerned when they leave their family members. The most challenging part of this project was the dashboard design. I was trying to come up with the minimal design and at the same time have all the requested tasks by the user to create the minimum viable product.

          <div class="learning">
            <p>If I had more time, I would add more details to the project. I would create a new survey to ask the potential users how they want to add a new member to the support system.Do they like to send a link to them, share the link to join, or add their email address? Also, I would design a more private platform to be able to keep the information secure on the platform. <br> The most important lesson that I’ve learned from this project was how a new idea could be expanded in detail and takes forever. As a designer, I need to focus on the high priority needs of the users. After making sure the platform is robust enough, I can work on the details.
